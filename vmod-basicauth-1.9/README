Vmod-basicauth README
See the end of file for copying conditions.

* Overview

This module implements basic HTTP authentication against the password file
created with the htpasswd(1) utility.  The following password hashes are
supported: Apache MD5, crypt(3), SHA1, and plaintext.

The module has been tested with Varnish versions 6.0.0 to 6.4.0.

* Example

import basicauth;

sub vcl_recv {
	if (!basicauth.match("/var/www/.htpasswd",
		             req.http.Authorization)) {
		error 401 "Authentication required";
	}
}	

* Installation

In order to compile the package you need to have the varnishd and
varnishapi packages installed.

Supposing that condition is met, run:

  ./configure

It should be able to automatically find the necessary components. In case 
it doesn't, tweak the configuration variables as necessary. The most 
important one is PKG_CONFIG_PATH, which contains a path (in the UNIX sense)
where the .pc files are located. It should contain a directory where the
'varnishapi.pc' file lives. Example usage:

  ./configure PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/varnish/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH

Please read the file INSTALL for a detailed discussion of available variables
and command line options.

Once configured, do

  make

This will build the module.  After this step you can optionally run
'make test' to test the package.

Finally, run the following command as root:

  make install
  
* Documentation

The manual page vmod_basicauth(3) will be available after successful
install.  To read it without installing the module, run
'man src/vmod_basicauth.3'.
